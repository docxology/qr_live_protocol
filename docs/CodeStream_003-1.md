## What is the QR Live Protocol?

**1-sentence answer:** QR Live Protocol (QRLP) is a comprehensive system for generating live, verifiable QR codes with cryptographic authentication, blockchain verification, and time synchronization for livestreaming and official video releases.

**3-sentence answer:** QR Live Protocol (QRLP) is a sophisticated authentication system that generates real-time QR codes containing cryptographically verifiable data including blockchain hashes, NTP-synchronized timestamps, and system identity fingerprints. The protocol provides multi-layered verification through Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain integration, multiple time server synchronization, and identity authentication to ensure content authenticity and temporal integrity. QRLP enables content creators, news organizations, and institutions to embed live-updating proof-of-authenticity directly into their video streams, creating an immutable chain of verification that can be independently validated by viewers.

## Implementation Notes

There probably are other different implementations of the protocol available today and tomorrow. This is just one, vibe-coded, instance.

Used exactly like this, you can already use this with OBS virtual camera (e.g. include this overlay in your own video).

## Future Vision

This is just a simple version of what could be:
- Built into video platforms
- Built into streaming software  
- Integrated with more cryptographic and steganographic methods
- Extended with advanced identity verification systems
- Implemented across content distribution networks
- Integrated with decentralized verification networks
- Enhanced with advanced temporal intelligence frameworks
- Expanded to support multi-modal authentication (audio, visual, metadata)

## Resources & Links

- **Live Demo**: Run `python examples/livestream_demo.py`
- **Documentation**: See `/docs` directory for comprehensive guides
- **Quick Start**: `python -m src.cli live` for immediate QR generation
- **Web Interface**: `http://localhost:8080` after starting the protocol

## Technical Requirements for Viewers

To verify QR codes shown during stream:
1. QR code scanner (mobile app or desktop tool)
2. JSON parsing capability for verification data
3. Internet connection for blockchain/time server validation
4. Optional: QRLP verification tools for automated checking
