# Changelog

All notable changes to QR Live Protocol (QRLP) will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-22

### Architecture
- Added `VerificationResult` dataclass to replace the untyped dict returned by
  `verify_qr_data` — enables cleaner API and type checking. Exported from `src`.
- Added `QRData.to_dict()` method — returns a clean dict without None entries,
  suitable for JSON serialization or API responses.
- Added `QRData.__repr__` and `QRData.__str__` for better debugging output.

### Security
- Added Content-Security-Policy headers to all web responses (CSP, X-Content-Type-Options,
  X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy).

### Performance
- Added `requests.Session` connection pooling to `BlockchainVerifier` — uses
  keep-alive connections for all blockchain API calls instead of creating a new
  connection per request.

### Code Quality
- Removed 29 unused imports across 9 source files (async_core, blockchain_verifier,
  core, crypto/encryptor, crypto/key_manager, crypto/signer, identity_manager,
  time_provider, web_server).

### New CLI Commands
- `qrlp config-validate <path>` — validate a configuration file without starting QRLP.
- `qrlp status --json-output` — output status as machine-readable JSON.

### Tests
- **567 tests** (up from 547), **0 failures**.
- Added `tests/test_v12_features.py` — 20 tests for VerificationResult, QRData.to_dict/__repr__,
  config-validate, status --json, CSP headers, and connection pooling.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-22

### Security Fixes
- **CRITICAL**: Renamed `KeyError` to `KeyManagementError` in `crypto/exceptions.py` — the
  previous name shadowed Python's built-in `KeyError`, which could cause unexpected behavior
  in any code path where crypto exceptions were imported.
- Removed MD5 hash algorithm support from `IdentityManager` — MD5 is cryptographically broken
  and should not be used for identity verification. Unknown algorithms now fall back to SHA-256.
- Removed `--break-system-packages` flag from `setup.py` auto-install path, which could silently
  modify the system Python installation.
- Fixed `web_server.py` rate limiter thread safety — the `request_log` dict was accessed without
  a lock from concurrent request threads. Added a `threading.Lock` to protect the rate-limit
  window computation.
- Replaced `datetime.utcnow()` (deprecated in Python 3.12+) with `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`
  throughout `web_server.py` (12 occurrences).

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed redundant `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` call in `core.py` `verify_qr_data` — the `now`
  variable was computed but not used for the time difference calculation.
- Fixed `blockchain_verifier.py` `_update_if_needed` race condition — the `_updating` flag was
  checked with `hasattr` (which returned False after the first update) instead of `getattr`,
  potentially spawning multiple background update threads. Added `_update_all_chains_safe`
  wrapper that clears the flag in a `finally` block.
- Fixed `QRData.from_json` to handle unknown fields gracefully — previously crashed with
  `TypeError` on forward-compatible QR payloads containing new fields. Now filters to known
  dataclass fields only.
- Fixed `signer.py` double canonicalization — `create_signed_qr_data` and `verify_signed_qr_data`
  both canonicalized the payload before passing to `sign_qr_with_key`/`verify_qr_signature`,
  which canonicalized again. While idempotent, this was wasteful and could mask bugs.
- Fixed `config.py` `from_env` double `os.getenv` calls — every environment variable was read
  twice (once in the `if` check, once in the assignment). Refactored to store the value in a
  local variable.
- Fixed `async_core.py` `_get_time_from_server_async` ignoring the `server` parameter — always
  queried `worldtimeapi.org` regardless of which NTP server was requested. The `server` parameter
  is now correctly used as the key in the returned dict.
- Fixed `_apply_cryptographic_enhancements` in `core.py` to use proper `logging.warning` instead
  of `print()` for encryption failure messages.
- Fixed `aiofiles` import in `async_core.py` — imported unconditionally but not in dependencies.
  Made the import optional with try/except.

### Improvements
- Replaced all `print()` calls with `_logger.info/warning/error()` across 9 source files.
  Each module now has its own named logger (`qrlp.core`, `qrlp.blockchain`, etc.).
- Added `HMACError` to the public API exports in `crypto/__init__.py` and `src/__init__.py`.
- Added `pytest-asyncio` to dev dependencies and configured `asyncio_mode = "auto"`.
- Added `aiofiles` and `psutil` to optional `[full]` dependencies.
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `.qrlp/`, `*.key`, `key_metadata.json`, `.master_key`.
- Fixed `_logger` placement in 6 source files — added proper blank lines before and after
  the logger initialization lines.
